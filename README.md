# About

This repository analyzes viral genomes from Washington State using [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org/). This is a copy of the [original Nextstrain ncov](https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov/) repository that has been modified for Washington-specific builds. These modifications draw heavily from work by John Huddleston in the [SPHERES augur build](https://github.com/nextstrain/spheres-augur-build).
